## Meeting Details

## Points to ask clients
### Admin stuff
- telling them that nick is typing and I'll be asking questions
- plan for monthly meetings staggered with different clients but could add always add more meetings
- if ever there are questions today you're uncomfortable with or that you don't know the answer, that is fine, we have a bunch of different things we can talk about, it's more important that you feel comfortable with us and our conversations
- do you have any questions before we begin?

### Client personality
- tell us a bit about yourself 
- aiming for fantasy theme, have you ever played any video games or watched movies/anime that would fit this genre? how interested are you in this type of aesthetic? 
- do you consider yourself as someone who is always on top of your ongoing tasks or you feel like you're always behind? tell us about that. 

### Productivity system
- do you consider yourself to be a person who has a personal productivity/task management system
- What usually stops you from completing tasks — motivation, forgetting, overwhelm, unclear next steps?
- When you fall off your productivity system, what causes it?
- What would a “win” look like for you after using an app like this for a month?

### Game mechanics
- an intro about the project (task page, basic todo list with game elements, tasks = damage/battle)
- How do you feel about game mechanics like leveling up, rewards, streaks, or character progression?
  - Which of these give you joy and motivate you and which aren't really that impactful?
- Would you want the app to challenge you (boss fights, time pressure) or stay chill and supportive?

### Usage patterns 
- have you used any productivity-type apps like as part of this system in the past (google calendar, google tasks, flora...), what was your experience
- When you use a task list of any kind, what kind of information is most useful to you, things like, effort, priority, due date...
- When during the day do you usually check or update your tasks?
  - Do you prefer quick but frequent interactions (10–20 seconds) or longer planning sessions?

### Constraints
- What would make you stop using a productivity app (or any app) immediately? what are things that annoy you when it comes to mobile apps? 
- Are there any accessibility needs or preferences we should keep in mind? (visual, auditory, cognitive impairements) 

### Check-in/conclusion
- What part of this concept excites you the most?
- What part feels confusing or unnecessary?
- If you could change one thing about the idea, what would it be?

### Additional topics
#### Accountability
- How do you feel about notifications — helpful, annoying, or depends on context?
- Would you want the app to nudge you when you’re falling behind, or stay hands‑off?

#### Social Features
- Would you ever want to share progress with friends or compete/cooperate?
- Do you prefer a private experience or something more social?
