## Meeting Details
- Where: Remote
- Who: Vincent, Nick, Robin
- When: 4:30 - 5:30 

## Points to ask clients
### Admin stuff
- [x] telling them that nick is typing and I'll be asking questions 
- [x] plan for monthly meetings staggered with different clients but could add always add more meetings
- [x] if ever there are questions today you're uncomfortable with or that you don't know the answer, that is fine, we have a bunch of different things we can talk about, it's more important that you feel comfortable with us and our conversations
- [ ] do you have any questions before we begin?

### Client personality
- [x] tell us a bit about yourself
  - Thrid year history student, taking history to be a writer, wants to be a fantasy writer. Neurodivergent 
- [x] aiming for fantasy theme, have you ever played any video games or watched movies/anime that would fit this genre? how interested are you in this type of aesthetic?
  - Enjoyes a lot of reading in the fantasy genre, watches video games, has played D&D
  - Favorite fantasy books? Good Omens
- [x] do you consider yourself as someone who is always on top of your ongoing tasks or you feel like you're always behind? tell us about that.
  - they need a lot of organization, they are a procrastinator and need a way to stay ahead of tasks. They make spreadsheets to keep track of everything, they've used calendars but have problems with them
    
### Productivity system
- [x] do you consider yourself to be a person who has a personal productivity/task management system
  - fallen in and out of use of task management systems, they have difficulty to set them up efficiently, they've used Notion before but its a lot of work 
- [x] What usually stops you from completing tasks — motivation, forgetting, overwhelm, unclear next steps?
  - motivation to procrastinate comes from the feeling of having time, sometimes they forget, sometimes they have task paralysis 
- [ ] When you fall off your productivity system, what causes it? 
- [x] What would a “win” look like for you after using an app like this for a month?
  - if the gamified part encouraged me to do something before a deadline so that I have free time because a task early that would be an ideal win for them
  - right now they have a passive task tracking system, so a win would be getting ahead of tasks and finishing before deadlines 

### Game mechanics
- [x] an intro about the project (task page, basic todo list with game elements, tasks = damage/battle)
  - everything sounds good, one question: with the monsters are you planning to have visuals or text base? We will have visuals for the monsters, the task page will be text, but we want the battle page to have sprites for the characters and the monsters, that page is dedicated to feeling like a game and not an app. They would like to be able to see things to make it more feel real and be involved more. 
- [x] How do you feel about game mechanics like leveling up, rewards, streaks, or character progression? Which of these give you joy and motivate you and which aren't really that impactful?
  - Motivation comes from Hp, visuals (see the progress of the character from the beginning), the streak is a really good idea to have more incentive to complete tasks but losing the streaks would be really demoralizing so they wouldn't want to open the app
  - Penalties are important to keep incentiving users to keep completing tasks
- [x] Would you want the app to challenge you (boss fights, time pressure) or stay chill and supportive?
  - Somewhere in between because you want to have a certain level of tasks completing more often to have a little boost of positivity. Having a balance is a good idea
  - Personal customization could come into play here to make it more tailored for each user (having different settings for default backgrounds etc)  

- [x] We asked them to keep us accountable on the philosphy of our game/productivity app

### Usage patterns 
- [x] have you used any productivity-type apps like as part of this system in the past (google calendar, google tasks, flora...), what was your experience
  - They've used Finch but it doesnt have enough penalties, they felt no motivation to keep doing tasks so they gave up on the app. Once the novelty wore off it loses the motivation 
- [x] When you use a task list of any kind, what kind of information is most useful to you, things like, effort, priority, due date...
  - Repeating tasks are important (other options like every weekday, every x number of days)
- [x] When during the day do you usually check or update your tasks? Do you prefer quick but frequent interactions (10–20 seconds) or longer planning sessions?
  - Its healthier to check once or twice a day, they worry that it will make it more stressful to constantly check 

- [x] We were discussing fields to show on the task quick view?
  - Due Date, Labels
  - Being able to color code things is important too, having different colors for expressing the importance of tasks
  - Red dates when its closer to the due date
  - They asked what about tasks that are over due? We would need to think about a way to handle overdue tasks, what color would they be, etc? Maybe having a state for overdue tasks would be important. 
  
- [x] Using icons + colors combo would save a lot of space and help show a lot more than just words (maybe change the priority and effort values, etc) 

### Constraints
- [x] What would make you stop using a productivity app (or any app) immediately? what are things that annoy you when it comes to mobile apps?
  - First of all, the notifications system, if theres excessive notifications they will get annoyed and delete the app
  - Secondly, having a monopoly on the content of the app, having a paywall to block certain aspects of the apps. Also, apps which gives you rewards that arent good but the good rewards are behind paywalls
- [x] Are there any accessibility needs or preferences we should keep in mind? (visual, auditory, cognitive impairements)
  - No shaking screens and flashing colors 
  - Having good font sizes to make reading easier

### Check-in/conclusion
- [x] What part of this concept excites you the most?
  - Excited to be able to have a hand on the creation of the app and giving us feedback on the progress 
- [ ] What part feels confusing or unnecessary?
- [ ] If you could change one thing about the idea, what would it be?

- [x] They have an iPhone (will have to figure out how to download on their phone remotely) 

### Additional topics
#### Accountability
- [ ] How do you feel about notifications — helpful, annoying, or depends on context?
- [ ] Would you want the app to nudge you when you’re falling behind, or stay hands‑off?

#### Social Features
- [ ] Would you ever want to share progress with friends or compete/cooperate?
- [ ] Do you prefer a private experience or something more social?
