## Meeting Content
- Started by completing documentation standards and conventions
- Completed the Outline of our project in the [.github README.md](.github/profile/README.md)
- Created a requirements document template

- We discussed initial details for the app:
  - Monster:
    - Contains (Health, Image Asset, Name, Regen Rate, Rank (later))
    - Monster Health will be calculated by (player dmg x historical stats x base monster health)

  - Task:
    - Every time a task is completed it should do damage to a monster (player dmg x task effort)
    - The task management system should be easy to use by having 4 sections (Title, Description, Effort, Due Date)
    - Title and Effort are required fields
    - Tasks should have a way to set them as pinned to show at the top of the list 

  - Gameplay: 
    - We are going with a progression style gameplay where there's different "Worlds" and "Levels" per world
    - After defeating a monster there's a cooldown time until the next monster to incentive users to take a break:
      - [ ] Idea 1 : If they continue completing tasks, it will do premature damage to the next monsters shield or egg
      - [x] Idea 2 : Whenever a user beats a monster, there's smaller monsters they can fight to get rewards (xp for their character) until the cooldown is over and a bigger monster shows up.
    
  - Daily task goals will be set per account and will be dynamic and will change according to frequency of tasks completed
