## Meeting Content
- Having many priorities from low to medium to high is not a good way to split tasks.
  Low priority tasks can creep up and become high priority before the due date.
  Better way to have multiple tasks?
  Work changes from time to time with different life events (dynamic nature of tasks evolving)
  Priority shift and deadlines shift 
- It needs to understand that people will have dynamic priority shifting. There's hard deadlines, there's softer deadlines.
  Self driven deadlines (something will hang over me if I dont do it)
- New tasks that are created should be created at the bottom of the list
- Have a clear seperation of "older" tasks and "new" tasks
- Needs to sync from computer and phone?? Possible with Flutter but idk how it would work from the backend
- Categories of tasks?

- Client: maybe the professor daughter
