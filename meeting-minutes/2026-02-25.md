- 1 or 2 weeks after installing he app on the clients phones we will have a feedback meeting

- After the feedback meeting, we will meet the clients once again when we finish the battle page and want them to install it

### Task Modal Updates (Frontend) 
- Add end date and add a field for starts on in the same row (default to todays date but should let user click on it to open a calendar select to pick a date)
- Add Effort and Priority to the same row
- Add description to the bottom of the modal
- Make labels smaller

### Request Authentication (Frontend)
- From Firebase there should be a token given once signed in, that token needs to be sent with the request to the backend to get access to the users tasks and everything
- Every request has to have "Bearer + token_string"
- We need to set up the display name modal to connect users from the users table to the user id in our backend tasks table
  - For Create User: When the display name is set, it sends a request to the users table in our backend, the users table will create a new row with the display name and the firebase uid (which is inferred from the token) in the request
- For task creation: you no longer need to pass the uid, because everytime you submit the request every time the backend gets the firebase uid and scans the users table to match the firebase uid then it sets a user id for the tasks

### List of endpoints to connect to frontend
- Every request starts with the {baseurl} from railway /api/v1/
- Labels:
  - Get Labels (/labels): when creating a task and populating the dropdown options for users to choose from, it will return a list of the form: color, id, text
  - Post Labels: when you create a new label on the modal (typing the title), all to do is send the text, the label will be returned with the new label object so I dont need to refetch them all again, it will be added to the list
  - Get labels by ID: When users click to edit a task this should be populated for them
  - Delete/Update Labels by ID: should be sent to delete/update the labels (create an issue for it, not neccesary rn)

- Tasks: Only difference is not including the uid in the request
  - Get Tasks (/tasks?status=in_progress): Gets all tasks for the users, return a task output with labels{id} in it
  - Post Tasks (/tasks): to create a task
  - Patch Tasks (/tasks): to patch task with a new status (Delete, Completed, etc)
  - Get Tasks by ID: maybe could be useful for the edit modal
  - Delete Tasks: not used yet
 
- Users:
  - Post User (/users): when the display name modal gets submitted, send the display name to the backend so it creates the user object

### Repeat Button (Frontend) 
- A repeat button on the task modal
- It should be a dropdown that lets you select: No repeat, Simple(default): starts on (default to todays date but should let user click on it to open a calendar select to pick a date),
daily, weekly, monhtly, yearly and a custom repeat button
- If the custom repeat button is clicked then: will open a modal for repeating task
- The modal should just have a dropdown and a starts on field at first thats visible with the types of repeat task: day, week, month, year
- Takes starts on value from the task modal
- Depending on the type selected the different fields should show up on the modal
- Day: amount of days between each reccurent/frequency (could be daily, every 3 days, etc), based on (radio buttons (start date, completion date) if its starts date then the next one will start the time after it start date, if it completed date then completed)
- Weekly: every/frequency (buttons for every day of the week, can select more than one, should default to current day, sunday should be the first day of the week, there should be values of 0-6 with the label of S, M, T, etc.)
- Monthly: every/frequency (select a day, should be able to a day), repeats on (radio buttons, every month on that day for example the 19th of every month, or other option is day of the week so for example the third thursday of the month)
- Yearly: every/frequency (select a day, should be able to a day), repeats on (radio buttons, every year on that day for example the march/19th of every year, or other option is week of the year so for example the third thursday of march)
- Add a summary at the end of the repeat task custom modal to have a summary in words to explain before users confirm selection. For example, "Task repeats on the third thursday of march every year".
- Just have to send the value of the forms, no need to do the calculations on the frontend, that is handled by the backend
